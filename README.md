## 🕹️ **How to Play**

1. **Enter the names** of the two players at the start of the game.
2. Players take turns selecting a spot on the board (by entering a number from 1-9) to place their mark (either **X** or **O**).
3. The game will check for a winner after each turn and declare the winner or prompt you for the next move.
4. If the board is filled with no winner, the game will declare it a draw.
   
  💡 **Pro Tip**: If you enter a number already taken, you will be asked to try again!
